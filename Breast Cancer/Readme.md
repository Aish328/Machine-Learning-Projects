# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer based on various features.
## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment. This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using a dataset containing various attributes like tumor size, shape, and texture.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from sklearn.datasets. It consists of load_breasy_cancer dataset universaslly available .

The Dataset consists of Key-Value pairs were keys inclue:

1.data

2.target

3.frame

4.target_name

5.DESCR

6.feature_names

7.filename

8.data_module

Each value has certain numerical values in exponential format
