Prediction Algorithm:

1.calculate the distance from x t all points in the data

2. sorts the points in the data according to the increasing distance from x
   
3. predicts the majority labels of "K" closest points
   
5. value of K is difficult to determine

PROS :

1.Simple 

2.Training is Trivial 

3.Works with any number of classes

4. easy to add new data
   
5.. contains less parameters
   

CONS:

High Prediction cost

Insufficient with high dimensional data

categorical feratures dont work well
