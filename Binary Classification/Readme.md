The Drug Discovery model is a Binary classification model , working on classification between active and inactive viral bodies and their effect.

The data is driven from Chembl database , the universal database containing Information about the bioactivity of different organisms and  their target sites.
It is collection  of 133x44 matrix storing information various organisms and their respective id's.

The model uses Random forest classifier to classify the acitivity of organisms into "acitve " and  "inactive" according to their concecntration.

The model focuses on SARSCorona virus neglecting the "intermediate" occurance hence making the classifier as binary Classiier.
